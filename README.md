# Biking Rental Service
The main objective of this website is to provide users with a simple and intuitive platform to browse available bikes, rent them, and manage their rentals. It also includes admin-level functionality to add, edit, or remove bikes, and monitor rental activity.
# Description
The Bike Rental Service is a web-based application that enables users to explore bikes, view their descriptions, images, rental price, and availability. Registered users can rent bikes, extend their rental duration, and manage their account through a personalized profile dashboard. Admins have special privileges, such as adding new bikes, editing bike details inline, or removing bikes that are not currently rented. The platform includes dynamic UI components like in-place editing, confirmation dialogs, modal popups, and notification alerts for better feedback and interactivity.

It includes a login/signup system, balance management, and built-in checks (like preventing deletion of rented bikes). The application uses a MySQL database to store user and rental data and follows a role-based system for feature access. This project also served as a full-stack development learning experience using Flask, Jinja2, and SQLAlchemy.
